                          BUG 2

Creator:

Description:
    Status bar was too big and also we were using the wrong number for our maximum scan line register
Solution:
    Realized that I had to find out to use 200-18 for the start and multiply that by 2 for scan doubing and decrement by 1 since it's 0 incremented.
    So essentially had to use 363 in binary and match up digits with appropriate registers and bits.

Description:
    Using the bitmask in text.c incorrectly. First forgot to mask it with one, then would shift in my horizontal line for loop instead 
    of the one for each bit
Solution:
    Initialize bitmask to x80 (10000000) then move the bitmask >>= 1 to at the end of my 'j' for loop

Description:
    Logic for drawing to middle of status bar was incorrect. Was trying to start drawing at index 20, but that wasn't centering 
Solution:
    Needed to factor length of computer message into determining starting location. (40-string length) / 2 would be the start
